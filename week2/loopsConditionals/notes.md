# Conditionals in JS

- In JS, you have conditionals in the form of the words

```
if...else
if...else if...else
```

The syntax we use to write conditionals is as follows

```
if (this condition is true) {
    ...do some code here
} else {
    ...do some other code
}
```

# Loops

## For Loop

```
for (let i = 0; i < condition; i++) {
    // code to repeat
}
```
