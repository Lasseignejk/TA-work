# Javascript 101

All programming langs contain certain things in them. These things are variables, functions, loops, and other similar things. How they are written and used is usually different for each language but the underlying concepts are generally the same.

Syntax, these are the rules of the language you are using.
If your code does not compile, it more than likely is a syntax error.

## Variables

- To create a variable in JS, you have to start with 3 words, 2 of which you should use for now and one to avoid.

All variables have to start with either const, var, or let and then a name. You then assign (using the + sign) it a value.

A variable name is up to you. It does not matter what you call it as long as you are not repeating another variable name. The best practice is to be explicit and literal with the name.

A good name is as follows:
`const studentName = "Ashley"`

A bad name is as follows:
`const b = 123`

`const` stands for constant. This means if you define something with `const`, it will not change.

`let` stands for let. This is used if you want to make a variable that you might change the value of later.

```
let ta = "Jaye"
ta = "Randy"
ta = "Becky"
```

`var` is old. We don't use it that much anymore. It stands for `variable`

You define a variable by using the words const let var, a name for the variable, and the assignment operator (=)

## Data Types

1. Strings
2. Integers
3. Floats
4. Booleans
5. Arrays
6. Objects

### Strings

Anything in `""` or `''` or in JS, ``

Strings are iterable. They are also indexed.

### Integers

A whole number (nothing with a decimal).

Integers are not iterable. However, they can have mathematical logic applied to them. + - x / to your heart's content

### Float

Any number with a decimal.
